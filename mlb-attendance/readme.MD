# MLB attendance grapher

R script to download data on current-year MLB attendance and stadium capacity, and graph two different looks at the data. It also saves a CSV of the home attendance data.

Tested on 2016/08/29. Not guaranteed to work in future seasons, especially if team names change.

Created largely as an exercise in both web-scraping and ggplot graphics.

Updated on 2019/04/17 to modernize the code.

Will produce this:

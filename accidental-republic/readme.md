# Data for "The Accidental Republic"

This repository contains R code used to generate graphs to accompany a presentation about 1870s French politics for the Jan. 10, 2017 "Let's Nerd Out Twin Cities" event.

The file `accidentalrepublic.r` will create five graphs that can be seen in the presentation, such as this:

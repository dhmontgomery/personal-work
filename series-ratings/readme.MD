# World Series ratings visualizer

An R script that will scrape data about World Series ratings from Wikipedia, and then graph it.

It will produce two ggplot charts: one [graphing the total viewers](https://github.com/dhmontgomery/personal-work/blob/master/series-ratings/ratings.png) of each World Series game, and one [faceted](https://github.com/dhmontgomery/personal-work/blob/master/series-ratings/ratings-facet.png) by which game of the Series it was.

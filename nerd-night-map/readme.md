# The Fast and the Mapped: A Demo of Digital Mapping

On April 12, 2018, I presented a live demo of making digitals maps using the free [QGIS](http://qgis.org) software to [the monthly "Nerd Out!" meeting](https://www.facebook.com/events/227324144509145/) of the "Nerds of the Twin Cities" meetup group.

You can view my slide deck [here](http://dhmontgomery.com/files/nerdsmn_maps.html#1).

The bulk of my presentation (after the "Live demo" slide) was taken up with a live demo. 

You can view my walkthrough for creating that presentation [here](https://github.com/dhmontgomery/personal-work/blob/master/nerd-night-map/walkthrough.md). That contains links to download all the map files necessary to create the project. You'll also need the `zoning_colors.qml` file included in this folder. 

Following those instructions should create something that looks a little like this:
